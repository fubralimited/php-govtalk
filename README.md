php-govtalk
===========

PHP client library designed to assist in developing web-based applications which interface with the UKâ€™s Government Gateway through the use of the standard message envelope.

The GovTalk Message Envelope is a standard developed by the United Kingdom government as a means of encapsulating a range of government XML services in a single standard data format.

Historic commits can be seen in the project's old [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/php-govtalk/source/list). NB. No updated will be pushed to the Google Code repo from now on, all activity will take place on GitHub.
